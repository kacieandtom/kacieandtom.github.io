    <h1>About our engagement</h1>
    <div class="article-wrap">
      <p>Kacie and Tom got engaged on July 4, 2013 atop Mt. Tom in Easthampton, MA. Planning for the engagement, however, began many months before.</p>

<p>At the time, Kacie and Tom were on their third year living together in Massachusetts, moving to Easthampton in April. They were on a busy travel schedule, so the time between Tom’s acquirement of a ring sizer and the time he gave her the real thing was about eight months.</p>

<p>To further complicate matters, Kacie did not own a single ring, making a ring sizer necessary. Tom’s desire to make the ring a surprise greatly influenced his decision in January 2013 to provide a cold-ridden Kacie with a necessary and effective dose of Nyquil.</p>

<p>Confident that Kacie was finally asleep, Tom slipped several ring sizer rings on Kacie’s finger, their blue, plasticky feel not stirring his comatose fiancée-to-be. One ring, in true sitcom fashion, got stuck, but Tom’s yanking and pulling still did not wake her up.</p>

<p>Having successfully acquired the needed ring size, Tom ordered the ring with the simple, leaf-shaped emerald that he had been eyeing for months, made completely from recycled and lab-made materials. He couldn’t imagine Kacie wearing anything else.</p>

<p>The ring then made its journey to Tom’s mother’s house. He intended for his mother to receive the package, but that is when his brother intercepted it. After his brother posed some prying questions, Tom simply advised him to “Keep it secret. Keep it safe.”</p>

<p>And that he did. Several weeks later, the ring finally made its journey to <strike>Mount Doom</strike> the spare tire compartment of Tom’s 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier, where it remained hidden for several more weeks while Kacie used his rapidly deteriorating automobile, depleted of most of its tire tread, to work every day.</p>

<p>The day to finally ask Kacie to marry him came on July 4. To avoid the afternoon heat, they rose early and drove the five minutes to the Mt. Tom park entrance. Mosquitoes were biting furiously, making Kacie want to end the hike early.</p>

<p>Luckily as they reached the first outlook, the mood changed dramatically. As Tom fell behind, Kacie ran up to the outlook. “See, you could propose to me here,” joked Kacie. Tom’s response? “How about now?” Shock, muteness, then the eventual breakdown. Tom eventually remembered to get down on one knee, the question was asked, and obviously the answer was yes!</p>

<p>The rest of the morning was spent enjoying each other’s company, the view, the cool weather, and hiking farther along the trail before returning home.</p>
